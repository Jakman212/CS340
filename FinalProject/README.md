Overview
Students from various universities and schools can often struggle to organize their study materials through all of their different subjects they have to track. Many students rely on scattered tools, a combination of Google Docs, Quizlet, and even physical flashcards in order to prepare and practice for exams. This results in duplication, lost progress data, and very limited personalization.
Our study app aims to create a database driven study website that allows users to create, review, and track flashcards, quizzes, and topic-filtered vocabulary lists all in one place. Each user will be able to keep multiple study sets for different modules and topics, which allows a streamlined organization and an easy way to get learning materials. This system will support hundreds of users, with each maintaining dozens of study sets across various topics.
The platform will be able to handle up to 10,000 flashcards, 5,000 quiz attempts, and over 1,000 sessions at a time, ensuring scalability for classroom or institutional use. The platform allows users to track their learning progress and performance across quizzes, offering both personalization and analytics based on insights.
In this initial phase, we will focus on implementing core user functionality: flashcard creation, quiz generation, and progress tracking. These features will be built on a robust, scalable relational database structure that can later support advanced features such as analytics, collaborative study groups or adaptive learning recommendations.
